Subject: [PATCH] Make CallbackExecutor strict again

The correct fix for double scheduling is to avoid it. The reason
this class is used is because double scheduling causes issues
elsewhere, and it acts as an explicit detector of what double
schedules. Effectively, use the callback executor as a tool of
finding issues rather than hiding these issues.

This patch also reverts incorrect use(s) of the class by paper.

- getChunkFutureAsynchronously
  There is no risk at all of recursion. The future is executed on
  the chunk provider's thread queue, the same place general plugin
  load callbacks are executed on. Forcing the task execution into
  the callback executor also prevents the future from catching
  any exception thrown from it.
